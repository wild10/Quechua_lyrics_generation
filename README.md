# Lyrics text Generation using Deep Learning(LSTM)

Our first approach is to develop deep learning models to first accomplish the task of generating Spanish and Quechua lyrics automatically for the local music in Peru, this is really not explored task recently we got good outperforming models in text generation and we are interested in exploring this task in other scenarios like music lyrics generation. we are enthusiastically moved that this kind of technology using Artificial Intelligence can help to persevere our culture and contribute to the creating of the new music since in Peru we are daily losing our native language with all this kind of universal incursion in the music side. 

# Indigenous Text Generation with LSTM

## Overview

This project implements a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for generating indigenous text. By training on a dataset of indigenous language texts, the model learns patterns and structures to create coherent and contextually relevant sentences.

## Features

- **DAtaSet**: We collected a small dataset of the Quechua Christian songs, this is located in dataset, as well tried with other Spanish dataset.
- **Customizable Training**: This is part of the full notebook showed in the video.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow or Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

first you should create the virtual env or something similar with anaconda for the easy run
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/indigenous-text-generation.git
   cd Quechua_lyrics_generation
   python test.py
